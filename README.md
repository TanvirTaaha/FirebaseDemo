## FirebaseDemo
I wanted to learn **Firebase** and many components of it *(atleast the free portion)* so started making this app. 
Gradually started integrating Android jetpack architecture components: **ViewModels**, **LiveData**, and **MVVM pattern**.
I learned basics of **Room Persistence Library** and implemented it. Here I want to provide some of the resouces
and tutorials that I found most helpful working in this project.
